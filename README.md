This ePortfolio is a single-page website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a digital showcase of my background as a computer science student, highlighting my leadership roles, academic achievements, skills, and personal projects. The website is designed with a user-friendly interface, featuring sections that can be easily navigated through buttons and a lightbox feature for viewing images in a more detailed manner. If you're interested in creating your own ePortfolio, you can use this code as a starting point and customize it to reflect your own experiences and achievements. I also welcome contributions from others who wish to enhance this ePortfolio by adding more projects, information, or improving its design.
